  EQUA Start Terms of Use
---
## PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SITE. 
## 1. In General.

By using the EQUA Start LLC (“EQUA Start”) website (the "Site") or any EQUA Start applications or application plug-ins ("Applications"), you agree to follow and be bound by these terms of use (the "Terms of Use") and agree to comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including United States export and re-export control laws and regulations. In these Terms of Use, the words "you" and "your" refer to each customer, Site visitor, or Application user, "we", "us" and "our" refer to EQUA Start and "Services" refers to all services provided by us.

It is your responsibility to review these Terms of Use periodically. If at any time you find these Terms of Use unacceptable or ***if you do not agree to these Terms of Use, please do not use this Site or any Applications.*** We may revise these Terms of Use at any time without notice to you. If you have any questions about these Terms of Use, please contact our [Customer Care Center](mailto:support@equastart.io).

YOU AGREE THAT BY USING THE SITE, ANY APPLICATIONS, AND THE SERVICES YOU ARE AT LEAST 18 YEARS OF AGE AND YOU ARE LEGALLY ABLE TO ENTER INTO A CONTRACT.

**These Terms require the use of arbitration on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than jury trials or class actions, and also limit the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute.**

Please also refer to the EQUA Start [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy), which is incorporated herein by reference.

EQUA Start provides an online legal portal to give visitors a general understanding of the law and to provide an automated software solution for individuals who choose to prepare their own legal documents. Member-Clients need not download or even license EQUA Start software. The Site includes general information on commonly encountered legal issues. The EQUA Start Services also include a review of your answers for completeness, spelling, and for internal consistency of names, addresses and the like. At no time do we review your answers for legal sufficiency, draw legal conclusions, provide legal advice, opinions or recommendations about your legal rights, remedies, defenses, options, selection of forms, or strategies, or apply the law to the facts of your particular situation. **EQUA Start is not a law firm and may not perform services performed by an attorney. EQUA Start, its Services, and its forms or templates are not a substitute for the advice or services of an attorney.**

EQUA Start strives to keep its legal documents accurate, current and up-to-date. However, because the law changes rapidly, EQUA Start cannot guarantee that all of the information on the Site or Applications is completely current. The law is different from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and may be subject to interpretation by different courts. The law is a personal matter, and no general information or legal tool like the kind EQUA Start provides can fit every circumstance. Furthermore, the legal information contained on the Site and Applications is not legal advice and is not guaranteed to be correct, complete or up-to-date. Therefore, if you need legal advice for your specific problem, or if your specific problem is too complex to be addressed by our tools, you should consult a licensed attorney in your area.

From time to time, EQUA Start may perform certain attorney access services and introduce our visitors to attorneys through various methods, including but not limited to (i) legal plans, (ii) third party attorney directory listings, and (iii) third party limited scope agreements. At no time is an attorney-client relationship fostered or created with EQUA Start through the performance of any such services.

This Site and Applications are not intended to create any attorney-client relationship, and your use of EQUA Start does not and will not create an attorney-client relationship between you and EQUA Start. Instead, you are and will be representing yourself in any legal matter you undertake through EQUA Start's legal document service.

## 2. Privacy Policy.
EQUA Start respects your privacy and permits you to control the treatment of your personal information. A complete statement of EQUA Start's [current Privacy Policy can be found by clicking here](/privacy-policy). EQUA Start's Privacy Policy is expressly incorporated into this Agreement by reference.

When you open an account to use or access certain portions of the Site, Applications, or the Services, you must provide complete and accurate information as requested on the registration form. You will also be asked to provide a user name and password. You are entirely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password. You may not use a third party's account, user name or password at any time. You agree to notify EQUA Start immediately of any unauthorized use of your account, user name or password. EQUA Start shall not be liable for any losses you incur as a result of someone else's use of your account or password, either with or without your knowledge. You may be held liable for any losses incurred by EQUA Start, our affiliates, officers, directors, employees, consultants, agents and representatives due to someone else's use of your account or password.

In connection with the use of certain EQUA Start products or services, you may be asked to provide personal information in a questionnaire, application, form or similar document or service. This information will be protected pursuant to our [Privacy Policy](/privacy-policy). In addition, you grant EQUA Start a worldwide, royalty-free, nonexclusive, and fully sublicensable license to use, distribute, reproduce, modify, publish and translate this personal information solely for the purpose of enabling your use of the applicable service. You may revoke this license and terminate rights held by EQUA Start at any time by removing your personal information from the applicable service.

If you buy or download a form on our Site or Application, the terms and conditions of these Terms of Use control.

EQUA Start is not the publisher or author of the User Content. EQUA Start takes no responsibility and assumes no liability for any content posted by you or any third party.

Although we cannot make an absolute guarantee of system security, EQUA Start takes reasonable steps to maintain security. If you have reason to believe system security has been breached, contact us by [email](mailto:support@equastart.io) for help.

If EQUA Start's technical staff finds that files or processes belonging to a member pose a threat to the proper technical operation of the system or to the security of other members, EQUA Start reserves the right to delete those files or to stop those processes. If the EQUA Start technical staff suspects a user name is being used by someone who is not authorized by the proper user, EQUA Start may temporarily disable that user's access in order to preserve system security. In all such cases, EQUA Start will contact the member as soon as feasible.

EQUA Start has the right (but not the obligation), in our sole and absolute discretion, to edit, redact, remove, re-categorize to a more appropriate location or otherwise change any User Content.

### Rights and Responsibilities of EQUA Start Users or Other Posters of User Content.

Attorneys that submit User Content and provide advice do so at their own risk. 

Under United States federal law, you retain copyright on all works you create and post as User Content, unless you choose specifically to renounce it. In posting a work as User Content, you authorize other members who have access to that service to make personal and customary use of the work, including creating links or reposting, but not otherwise to reproduce or disseminate it unless you give permission for such dissemination.
